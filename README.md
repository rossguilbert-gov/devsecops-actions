## 🏗️ Architecture

### Key Architecture Concepts

1. **Reusable Workflow Pattern**: Workflows prefixed with `_` (e.g., `_sca.yml`) are designed to be called by other workflows
2. **Explicit Permissions**: Caller workflows must explicitly declare all required permissions
3. **Version Pinning**: Use `@vx.x.x` for latest updates or `@<commit-sha>` for stability
4. **Centralised Maintenance**: Developed and managed by PandA team, with future updates triggered automatically.

## 🚀 Available Workflows

### 🔍 SCA Workflow (`_sca.yml`)

**Reusable workflow** for comprehensive dependency management and security review.

#### Features

- 🛡️ Scans dependencies for security vulnerabilities in pull requests
- 🔄 Automatically discovers and updates outdated dependencies using Renovate Bot
- 🌐 Supports organisation-wide repository discovery (with appropriate token permissions)
- 💬 Provides PR comments with detailed SCA summaries
- 📊 Uses GitHub's SCA Action for vulnerability scanning

#### 🧩 Workflow

![Dependency Workflow Architecture](docs/dependency-workflow.svg)

#### Inputs

| Input              | Type   | Required | Default   | Description                 |
| ------------------ | ------ | -------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| `renovate-version` | string | No       | `42.64.1` | Renovate CLI version to use |

#### Required Secrets

| Secret  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `token` | GitHub token with the following permissions:<br>• `contents: write` (for committing updates)<br>• `pull-requests: write` (for creating/updating PRs)<br>• `issues: write` (for creating issues)<br>• `security-events: read` (for scanning vulnerabilities) |

#### Environment Variables

| Variable       | Required | Description                                      |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `TIMEZONE`     | No       | Timezone configuration from repository variables |
| `NODE_VERSION` | Yes      | Node.js version from repository variables        |

#### Concurrency

- Uses `moj-actions-dependencies` group to prevent parallel runs
- Does not cancel in-progress jobs

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Dependency Workflow

To use the reusable `_sca.yml` workflow in your repository:

#### Basic Usage

```yaml
name: SCA
run-name: SCA ⚡️

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *" # Run daily at midnight UTC

  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]

  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual trigger

permissions: {}

jobs:
  dependencies:
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
      security-events: read

    uses: ministryofjustice/devsecops-actions/.github/workflows/_sca.yml@v1.0.0
    secrets:
      token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

#### Advanced Usage with Custom Renovate Version

```yaml
name: SCA
run-name: SCA ⚡️

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 2 * * *" # Run daily at 2 AM UTC

  pull_request:
    branches: ["main", "develop"]

  workflow_dispatch:

permissions: {}

jobs:
  dependencies:
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
      security-events: read

    uses: ministryofjustice/devsecops-actions/.github/workflows/_sca.yml@v1.0.0
    secrets:
      token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    with:
      renovate-version: "42.64.1" # Specify custom Renovate version
```
