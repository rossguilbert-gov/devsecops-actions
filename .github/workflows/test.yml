# Test workflow for devsecops-actions repository
#
# This workflow runs automated tests on pull requests targeting the main branch.
# It consists of two main jobs:
#
# 1. setup: Prepares the test infrastructure by setting up environment variables
#    - Outputs: environment name and timezone for downstream jobs
#    - Sets environment to 'base' and uses repository-configured timezone
#
# 2. lint: Executes unit tests with coverage reporting
#    - Requires: setup job completion
#    - Permissions: read access to repository contents
#    - Environment: Uses environment output from setup job
#    - Steps:
#      a. Checks out the repository code
#      b. Configures Node.js using the version specified in repository variables
#      c. Installs npm dependencies and Syft tool (for SBOM generation)
#      d. Runs unit tests with coverage collection
#
# Permissions: Minimal permissions by default, with contents:read for the lint job
# Trigger: Activated on pull requests to the main branch
