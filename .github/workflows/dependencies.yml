# Dependencies Review Workflow
#
# Purpose:
#   Automates dependency management and security review for the repository using Renovate.
#   Runs on a schedule, manually via workflow dispatch, or on pull requests.
#
# Triggers:
#   - schedule: Daily at midnight (UTC)
#   - workflow_dispatch: Manual trigger
#
# Environment Variables:
#   - environment: Set to 'base' - defines the deployment environment
#   - timezone: Retrieved from repository variable TIMEZONE
#
# Jobs:
#   1. setup:
#      - Configures infrastructure settings
#      - Outputs environment and timezone for downstream jobs
#      - Runs on: ubuntu-latest
#
#   2. dependencies:
#      - Performs dependency review and updates using Renovate
#      - Requires: setup job completion
#      - Permissions: contents (write), pull-requests (write), issues (write), security-events (read)
#      - Steps:
#        * Checks out repository code
#        * Sets up Node.js environment with configured version
#        * Installs npm dependencies (excluding scripts)
#        * Runs Renovate bot for automated dependency updates
#      - Runs on: ubuntu-latest
#
# Security:
#   - Uses pinned action versions with commit SHAs for supply chain security
#   - Minimal permissions granted at workflow level (none by default)
#   - Job-specific permissions explicitly defined where needed
#
# Dependencies:
#   - actions/checkout@v6.0.1
#   - actions/setup-node@v6.1.0
#   - renovatebot/github-action@v44.2.0
#   - Renovate version: 42.64.1
