# Software Composition Analysis (SCA) Workflow
#
# This workflow performs automated security scanning of project dependencies to identify
# vulnerabilities, license issues, and outdated packages.
#
# Triggers:
#   - schedule: Runs daily at midnight (00:00 UTC)
#   - pull_request: Executes when PRs are opened against the main branch
#   - workflow_dispatch: Allows manual workflow execution
#
# Jobs:
#   1. setup: Initializes workflow environment configuration
#      - Sets the environment variable to 'base'
#      - Outputs environment name for downstream jobs
#
#   2. sca: Executes the Software Composition Analysis
#      - Permissions:
#        * contents: write - For creating/updating files
#        * pull-requests: write - For PR comments and updates
#        * issues: write - For creating security issues
#        * security-events: read - For accessing security scan results
#      - Uses MoJ's devsecops-actions/sca action (v1.1.0)
#      - Configuration:
#        * Authenticates using GitHub token
#        * Uses custom dependency review config from .github/dependency-review-config.yml
#      - Depends on successful completion of setup job
#      - Runs in the environment specified by setup job output
#
# Environment:
#   - Default environment: base
#
# Security:
#   - Workflow has minimal default permissions (none)
#   - Individual jobs specify required granular permissions
#   - Uses pinned action version with SHA for supply chain security
