# GitHub Actions Workflow: Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
#
# This workflow performs automated software composition analysis to identify
# security vulnerabilities and license compliance issues in project dependencies.
#
# Triggers:
#   - schedule: Runs daily at midnight (00:00 UTC)
#   - pull_request: Runs on pull requests targeting the main branch
#   - workflow_dispatch: Allows manual triggering from the GitHub UI
#
# Jobs:
#   1. setup: Initializes the workflow environment
#      - Outputs the environment name for downstream jobs
#      - Runs on ubuntu-latest
#
#   2. sca: Executes the software composition analysis
#      - Requires setup job to complete first
#      - Uses the MoJ devsecops-actions/sca action
#      - Permissions granted:
#        * contents: write - For repository content access
#        * pull-requests: write - For commenting on PRs
#        * issues: write - For creating security issues
#        * security-events: read - For accessing security alerts
#      - Configuration:
#        * Uses GITHUB_TOKEN for authentication
#        * Dependency review config file location: ./.github/dependency-review-config.yml
#
# Environment:
#   - Default environment: base
#   - Can be referenced by downstream jobs via outputs
#
# Security:
#   - Top-level permissions set to empty (none) by default
#   - Job-specific permissions explicitly defined where needed
