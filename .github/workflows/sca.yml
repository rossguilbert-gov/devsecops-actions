# Software Composition Analysis (SCA) Workflow
#
# Purpose:
#   Performs automated security composition analysis to identify vulnerabilities
#   in project dependencies and container images.
#
# Triggers:
#   - schedule: Daily at midnight (00:00 UTC)
#   - pull_request: When PRs target the any branch
#   - workflow_dispatch: Manual workflow execution
#   - branch_protection_rule: When branch protection rules are modified
#
# Permissions:
#   - contents: write - Required for updating dependency graphs
#   - pull-requests: write - Required for creating dependency review comments
#   - issues: write - Required for creating security advisories
#   - security-events: write - Required for uploading security scan results
#   - actions: read - Required for reading workflow run data
#
# Jobs:
#   setup:
#     - Prepares the infrastructure and environment configuration
#     - Outputs: environment name and timezone for downstream jobs
#
#   sca:
#     - Calls the reusable SCA workflow (.github/workflows/sca-reusable.yml)
#     - Checks out the repository code
#     - Configures Node.js environment
#     - Installs project dependencies
#     - Runs OWASP and CodeQL in parallel with the remaining sequential tools
#
# Configuration:
#   - Environment: base (configurable via env vars)
#   - Timezone: Configurable via repository variables (TIMEZONE)
#   - Dependency review config: .github/dependency-review-config.yml
#   - Docker images config: sources.json
#
# Required Variables:
#   - TIMEZONE: Repository variable defining the timezone for operations
#   - NODE_VERSION: Node.js version for the runtime environment
