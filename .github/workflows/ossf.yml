# OpenSSF Scorecard Security Workflow
#
# Purpose:
#   Runs OpenSSF Scorecard to assess the security posture of the repository
#   against best practices for open source security.
#
# Triggers:
#   - schedule: Daily at midnight (00:00 UTC)
#   - push: When code is pushed to the main branch
#   - branch_protection_rule: When branch protection rules are modified
#
# Permissions:
#   - contents: read - Access repository contents for scanning
#   - security-events: write - Upload security scan results to GitHub Security
#   - id-token: write - Required for publishing scorecard results
#
# Concurrency:
#   Ensures only one OSSF scan runs at a time per workflow reference.
#   Cancels in-progress runs when a new one is triggered.
#
# Jobs:
#   ossf:
#     - Checks out the repository with full history
#     - Runs OpenSSF Scorecard security assessment
#     - Generates results in SARIF format
#     - Uploads results to GitHub Code Scanning for visibility
#
# Output:
#   Security findings are available in the repository's Security tab
#   under Code Scanning alerts.
