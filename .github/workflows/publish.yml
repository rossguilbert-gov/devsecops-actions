# GitHub Actions workflow for automated releases
#
# This workflow automates the release process using Google's release-please action.
# It triggers on pushes to the main branch and creates versioned releases based on
# conventional commits.
#
# Workflow Structure:
#   1. setup: Configures the infrastructure and environment settings
#      - Outputs: environment name and timezone for downstream jobs
#      - Sets up base environment configuration
#
#   2. release: Executes the release process
#      - Dependencies: Requires setup job to complete
#      - Uses release-please-action to automate version bumps and changelog generation
#      - Requires RELEASE_TOKEN secret for repository write access
#
# Permissions:
#   - contents: write - Required for creating releases and tags
#   - issues: write - Required for closing/updating release-related issues
#   - pull-requests: write - Required for managing release PRs
#
# Configuration:
#   - Environment: base (configurable via env vars)
#   - Timezone: Configurable via repository variables (TIMEZONE)
#   - Release type: node (follows Node.js versioning conventions)
#
# Required Secrets:
#   - RELEASE_TOKEN: GitHub token with appropriate permissions for release operations
#
# Required Variables:
#   - TIMEZONE: Repository variable defining the timezone for operations
