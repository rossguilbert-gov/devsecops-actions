# GitHub Actions workflow for automated dependency review on pull requests
#
# This workflow performs security and license compliance checks on dependencies
# when pull requests are opened against the main branch.
#
# Workflow Components:
#   setup:
#     - Initializes workflow environment configuration
#     - Sets timezone and environment variables for downstream jobs
#     - Outputs: environment name and timezone settings
#
#   dependencies:
#     - Performs automated dependency review using GitHub's dependency-review-action
#     - Checks for security vulnerabilities, license issues, and policy violations
#     - Posts review summary as a comment on the pull request
#     - Requires: read access to repository contents, write access to pull requests
#
# Permissions:
#   - Workflow level: none (restrictive by default)
#   - Job level (dependencies): contents:read, pull-requests:write
#
# Triggers:
#   - Pull requests targeting the main branch
#
# Environment Variables:
#   environment: base - The deployment environment context
#   timezone: Configurable via repository variable TIMEZONE
#
# Security:
#   - Uses pinned action versions with commit SHA for supply chain security
#   - Follows principle of least privilege with minimal permissions
#   - Automated dependency scanning helps prevent vulnerable dependencies
